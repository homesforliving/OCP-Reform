# OCP-Reform
Overlay transit, grocery and distance to parks, services to show a more modern, health-oriented understanding of where homes should be located. And then hand that to council.

## How can I contribute?
We need data of ammenities in the City of Victoria. Create csv files with the geographic location and name of different categories of ammenities (e.g. schools, grocery stores). There's already some examples in the repo. Alternatively, go through existing csv files and add anything you think is missing. Currently the data is sourced from the google maps API (basically code that does a gmaps search for keywords and returns a list of locations).

Mark is writing some code to combine them all with the zoning and transit data we already have.
